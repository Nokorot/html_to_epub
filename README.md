# parahumans_scraper
A python script to convert a blog published web series into a Kindle friendly epub.


#About
I was reading a rather long web series and got tired of keeping track of my place across multiple devices and draining my pathetic phone battery.
Unfortunately the author decided not to provide an ebook in any form in hopes that he would be able to sell a book deal one day. I wish him
luck in that endevour, but I am not content to wait. Python to the rescue.


#Requirements
* python3
* ebooklib - https://github.com/aerkalov/ebooklib
* lxml - https://github.com/lxml/lxml
* tqdm - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm
